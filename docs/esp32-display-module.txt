Touch Screen Considerations (E32R35T)

Requires calibration for accurate coordinate mapping
Interrupt-driven (IO36) or polling modes available
Shares SPI bus - coordinate access with display operations

LED Control

Common anode configuration (active LOW)
Can be used for status indication

Audio Output

Enable via IO4 (LOW to enable)
DAC output on IO26
External speaker connection via 1.25mm connector

Battery Management

Monitor battery voltage via IO34 ADC
3.7V lithium polymer only
Built-in charging management

Arduino Framework Considerations

Use ESP32 board definition in PlatformIO
SPI library for display/touch/SD communication
Consider using display libraries like TFT_eSPI
WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities available
Multiple SPI devices require careful chip select management
